                    <p><span class="title">PolyU–Huawei Mathematical Optimization Innovation Laboratory (MOI Lab)</span>
                    was officially launched at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University on 17 September 2025 following the signing of a collaboration agreement between PolyU and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. 
                    As the first joint laboratory of Huawei in Hong Kong dedicated to developing <b>XPU-based advanced optimization solvers</b>, the MOI Lab marks a significant milestone in the long-standing partnership that began in 2007 and has fostered cooperation across communications, big data, algorithms, and materials science.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                    The MOI Lab focuses on advancing <b>mathematical optimization theory</b>, developing <b>cutting-edge algorithms</b>, and applying <b>XPU-accelerated solvers</b> to artificial-intelligence and data-science challenges. 
                    Leveraging PolyU’s strengths in mathematics, statistics, and operations research — ranked 31 st globally in Statistics and Operations Research by the 2025 QS World University Rankings and 36 th in Mathematics by U.S. News, the highest in Hong Kong — the collaboration aims to drive research and innovation at the intersection of academia and industry.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                    Witnessed by senior representatives from both institutions, including Prof. Christopher CHAO (Vice President, Research and Innovation, PolyU), Prof. Daniel LUO (Associate Dean, Research, Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, PolyU), Ms. Jie FU (Director, Technology Co-operation Department, Huawei) and Mr. Bo BAI (Director, Theoretical Research Department, Huawei), the agreement was signed by Prof. Defeng SUN (Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics, PolyU) and Mr. Yanhui GENG (Director, Huawei Hong Kong Research Centre). A plaque-unveiling ceremony was held to mark the official inauguration of the laboratory.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                    Prof. Christopher CHAO expressed his appreciation for Huawei’s continued support to PolyU, emphasizing that the partnership will nurture innovative talent, promote knowledge transfer, and accelerate the commercialization of research outcomes. Together, PolyU and Huawei are committed to advancing mathematical optimization and technological innovation, creating greater value and contributing to economic development.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>The objectives of the MOI Lab are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developing XPU-based advanced optimization solvers and scalable algorithmic frameworks for large-scale mathematical problems.</li>
                        <li>Advancing mathematical-optimization theory and designing cutting-edge algorithms for AI and data-science applications.</li>
                        <li>Promoting industry–academia collaboration and knowledge transfer through real-world deployments and open-source innovation.</li>
                        <li>Training the next generation of researchers and engineers in mathematical optimization and high-performance computing.</li>
                    </ul>
